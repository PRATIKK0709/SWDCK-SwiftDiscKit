  "content": "# Slash Commands\n\nSlash commands are the modern, recommended way for users to interact with your bot. They provide a native UI in Discord, auto-completion, and better discoverability.\n\n## Registering a Slash Command\n\nRegister commands directly on your `DiscordBot` instance. By default, SWDCK will sync these commands globally when the bot starts.\n\n```swift\nbot.slashCommand(\"ping\", description: \"Get a pong back!\") { interaction in\n    try await interaction.respond(\"Pong! \ud83c\udfd3\")\n}\n```\n\n### Command Options\n\nYou can define parameters (options) that users can fill out.\n\n```swift\nlet options = [\n    CommandOption(name: \"name\", description: \"Who should I greet?\", type: .string, required: true)\n]\n\nbot.slashCommand(\"greet\", description: \"Say hello to someone\", options: options) { interaction in\n    let name = interaction.option(\"name\")?.stringValue ?? \"there\"\n    try await interaction.respond(\"Hello, \\(name)!\")\n}\n```\n\n## Handling Interactions\n\nWhen a user runs a slash command, the `handler` closure is executed. The `Interaction` object provides everything you need to know about the command usage.\n\n### Interaction Properties\n\n| Property | Type | Description |\n|----------|------|-------------|\n| `user` | `DiscordUser?` | The user who ran the command (in DMs). |\n| `member` | `GuildMember?` | The member who ran the command (in a guild). |\n| `channelId` | `String?` | Where the command was run. |\n| `token` | `String` | The interaction token (used for verification/follow-ups). |\n\n---\n\n## Responding to Interactions\n\nYou have several ways to respond to a slash command.\n\n### Immediate Response\nSends a message that is visible to everyone (or just the user).\n```swift\ntry await interaction.respond(\"Command received!\")\n```\n\n### Ephemeral Responses\nOnly the user who ran the command can see these.\n```swift\ntry await interaction.respond(\"Shh, this is a secret.\", ephemeral: true)\n```\n\n### Deferring a Response\nIf your command takes longer than 3 seconds to process, you **must** defer the response. This shows a \"Thinking...\" state in Discord.\n```swift\ntry await interaction.defer_()\n// Perform long task...\ntry await interaction.editResponse(\"Finished processing!\")\n```\n\n### Follow-up Messages\nSend additional messages after the initial response.\n```swift\ntry await interaction.respond(\"Success!\")\ntry await interaction.followUp(\"And here is something else.\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## Global vs. Guild Commands\n\n- **Global Commands**: Available in all servers the bot is in and in DMs. (Synced automatically if `commandSyncMode` is `.global`).\n- **Guild Commands**: Available only in a specific server. These update instantly, making them great for development.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 **Tip:** To clear commands during development, use `try await bot.clearSlashCommands(guildId: \"YOUR_GUILD_ID\")`.\n\n> **Next:** [Components](./components)\n"
