      "content": "# Introduction & Overview\n\n**SWDCK** (SwiftDiscKit) is a high-performance, modern Discord bot framework written entirely in Swift. It leverages Swift's powerful concurrency model (`async/await`) to provide a seamless and efficient developer experience for building everything from simple notification bots to complex, interactive community tools.\n\nBuilt from the ground up to be lightweight yet feature-rich, SWDCK handles the complexities of the Discord Gateway and REST API, allowing you to focus on your bot's unique logic.\n\n## Why use SWDCK?\n\nCompared to other Discord libraries in the Swift ecosystem, SWDCK prioritizes:\n\n- **Modern Swift Concurrency**: Fully built on `async/await` and `Actors`, ensuring thread safety and readable asynchronous code.\n- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive models for Discord entities (Messages, Interactions, Guilds, etc.) reduce runtime errors.\n- **Developer Productivity**: A clean, intuitive API that feels \"Swifty\" and follows modern best practices.\n- **Rich Interaction Support**: First-class support for Slash Commands and the powerful \"Components V2\" system.\n\n## Feature Highlights\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Gateway Support** | Automatic connection management, heartbeat, and reconnection logic. |\n| **Slash Commands** | Easy registration and handling of global and guild-scoped commands. |\n| **Event System** | Type-safe closures for handling messages, member updates, and more. |\n| **Components V2** | Support for modern UI elements like buttons, select menus, and modals. |\n| **Rich Embeds** | A flexible builder for creating beautiful, formatted messages. |\n| **Full API Mapping** | Access to almost every Discord REST endpoint via a clean interface. |\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo build and run a bot with SWDCK, you'll need:\n\n- **Swift Version**: 5.9 or higher\n- **Platform**: macOS 14.0+ or iOS 17.0+\n- **Discord API**: v10 (handled automatically by the library)\n\n---\n\n## Documentation Map\n\n- [Installation](./installation) — Get set up and connected.\n- [Quick Start](./quick-start) — Your first \"Hello World\" bot.\n- [Core Concepts](./core-concepts) — Understanding the SWDCK mental model.\n- [Event System](./event-system) — Listen and react to Discord events.\n- [Messages](./messages) — Reading and sending messages.\n- [Embeds](./embeds) — Creating rich, formatted content.\n- [Slash Commands](./slash-commands) — Modern interactions.\n- [Components](./components) — Buttons, Selects, and Modals.\n- [API Reference](./api-reference) — Exhaustive technical documentation.\n\n> **Next:** [Installation](./installation)\n"

      "content": "# Installation\n\nSet up your development environment and get SWDCK added to your project.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore diving in, ensure you have the following:\n\n- **Xcode 15.0** or later.\n- **Swift 5.9** or later.\n- A **Discord Account** and access to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).\n\n## Discord Setup\n\n### 1. Create an Application\n1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).\n2. Click **New Application** and give it a name.\n3. On the left sidebar, click **Bot**.\n4. Click **Reset Token** (or **Copy Token**) to get your bot token. \n   > ⚠️ **Warning:** Keep this token secret! Anyone with it can control your bot.\n\n### 2. Enable Privileged Intents\nFor your bot to receive messages or track member updates, you must enable specific **Intents**:\n1. In the **Bot** tab of your application, scroll down to **Privileged Gateway Intents**.\n2. Enable **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** (required for reading message content).\n3. Enable **GUILD MEMBERS INTENT** (if you need to track members).\n4. Click **Save Changes**.\n\n### 3. Invite the Bot\n1. Go to **OAuth2** -> **URL Generator**.\n2. Select the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes.\n3. Select the permissions your bot needs (e.g., `Send Messages`, `Use Slash Commands`).\n4. Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to invite the bot to your server.\n\n---\n\n## Swift Package Manager Setup\n\nSWDCK is distributed as a Swift Package. You can add it via Xcode or your `Package.swift` file.\n\n### Via Xcode\n1. Open your project in Xcode.\n2. Select **File > Add Package Dependencies...**\n3. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/PRATIKK0709/SWDCK--SwiftDiscKit`\n4. Set the Dependency Rule to **Branch: main** (or a specific version if available).\n5. Select the `SWDCK` library and click **Add Package**.\n\n### Via Package.swift\nAdd the dependency to your `Package.swift` file:\n\n```swift\n// swift-tools-version: 5.9\nimport PackageDescription\n\nlet package = Package(\n    name: \"MyBot\",\n    dependencies: [\n        .package(url: \"https://github.com/PRATIKK0709/SWDCK--SwiftDiscKit\", branch: \"main\")\n    ],\n    targets: [\n        .executableTarget(\n            name: \"MyBot\",\n            dependencies: [\n                .product(name: \"SWDCK\", package: \"SWDCK\")\n            ]\n        )\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n## Verifying Installation\n\nTry to import the library in your main file to ensure everything is linked correctly:\n\n```swift\nimport SWDCK\n\nprint(\"SWDCK is ready!\")\n```\n\n> 💡 **Tip:** If you encounter build errors, double-check that your target platform is set to macOS 14.0+ or iOS 17.0+.\n\n> **Next:** [Quick Start: Your First Bot](./quick-start)\n"
