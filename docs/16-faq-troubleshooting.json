Check here first for solutions to common problems.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \u2753 My bot is online, but `onMessage` never fires.\n**Solution:** You likely haven't enabled the **Message Content Intent**.\n1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).\n2. Select your app -> **Bot**.\n3. Enable **Message Content Intent**.\n4. In your code, ensure you include `.messageContent` in your `intents`:\n   ```swift\n   let bot = DiscordBot(token: \"...\", intents: .default | .messageContent)\n   ```\n\n### \u2753 I registered a slash command, but it's not showing up in Discord.\n**Solution:** Global slash commands can take up to **one hour** to propagate to all servers. For instant testing, use **Guild Commands**:\n```swift\n// This updates instantly for the specific guild\ntry await bot.syncCommands(to: \"your_guild_id\")\n```\nAlso, ensure the bot was invited with the `applications.commands` scope.\n\n### \u2753 I get the error: \"Interaction already acknowledged\".\n**Solution:** You are trying to respond to an interaction that has already been responded to or deferred. You can only send one \"initial\" response. Use `followUp()` or `editResponse()` for subsequent updates.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting Tools\n\n### Enable Detailed Logging\nSWDCK logs important events to the console by default. If you are having connection issues, look for lines starting with `[SWDCK][Gateway]`.\n\n### Common Gateway Close Codes\n| Code | Meaning | Action |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 4004 | Authentication failed. | Your token is invalid. Reset it in the portal. |\n| 4014 | Disallowed intent. | You requested an intent (like `guildMembers`) that isn't enabled in the portal. |\n| 4010 | Invalid Shard. | You are trying to use more shards than allowed. (Usually handled automatically by SWDCK). |\n\n---\n\n## Still having trouble?\n\nIf your issue isn't listed here:\n1. Check the [Samples](./example-bot) to see if your setup matches.\n2. Open an issue on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PRATIKK0709/SWDCK--SwiftDiscKit/issues).\n3. Provide your Swift version, platform (macOS/iOS), and any error logs from the console.\n"
